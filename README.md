# Google Event Receiver

A prototype of receiving events from Google real-time developer notifications

## Description

This is a .NET Core Web API that will receive events from [Google](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/getting-ready#configure-rtdn) and place them in a DynamoDb table.
